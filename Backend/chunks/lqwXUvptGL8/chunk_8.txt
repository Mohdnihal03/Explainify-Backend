Sometimes allah subhanahu wa ta'ala withholds not to punish but to wake you up to a truth you would have never seen while everything was going because listen carefully when allah wants to elevate a believer, he does not send ease. He sends awareness. He sends a shift inside the heart. He sends a feeling that says something is missing and that something is me. And jobs, careers, cvs, interviews, they become secondary.
