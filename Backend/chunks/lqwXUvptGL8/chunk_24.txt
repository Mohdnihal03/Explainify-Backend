You rise by sincerity. You rise by turning your heart fully toward your creator. The journey ahead of you. If your life is silent now, if every application is ignored, if every effort feels it's going nowhere, if you feel stuck in the same place, then be grateful. Yes, grateful. Because this silence is a sign of something big being written. A shift, a breakthrough, a new destiny forming behind the scenes. A risk you cannot see yet. But your heart can feel it. Allah is moving you from where you were to where you're supposed to be. And in that journey, you are not rejected. You are realigned. You are prepared. You are elevated. You are purified. You are guided. You are being shaped for something better than you imagine. My beautiful ayul family, before you scroll, before this moment slips away, let's pause. Let's breathe. Let's bring our hearts together for a dua that might change your future, your risk, your path, your direction.
