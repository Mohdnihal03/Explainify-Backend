Your degree is not the source. Your risk can come wrapped in a phone call from nowhere. A stranger's recommendation. A business idea that pops into your heart. A door you didn't even knock on. This is the risk that comes with tawakul saddaka. Because charity is a magnet for blessings. Charity doesn't decrease your wealth. It multiplies it. It expands it. It blesses it. It purifies it. Give even one coin, one rupee, one date, one bottle of water. Not because you have a lot, but because you trust the one who owns the treasures of the heavens and the earth. The practical reality, you are not meant for a normal life.
