Because allah loves action. You can't just sit and wait. Even mariam alasam was told, "shake the trunk of the palm tree. " her effort couldn't bring dates down. But her obedience invited the miracle. Apply, learn, grow, move, try. But don't place your heart on the effort. Place your heart on the one who blesses the effort. Because sin blocks risk. This is a secret most people ignore.
