My dear brothers and sisters, if you've reached this point, then you already know your journey is not about chasing jobs. It's about chasing the one who opens the doors to risk. Now in this final part, i want to take you into the heart of this reminder. The part that unlocks the path ahead of you. The part that reveals why allah is putting you through this phase and how you can finally walk toward the risk written for you with clarity, certainty, and peace. The spiritual truth. Risk doesn't begin with your hand. It begins with your heart. Most people chase money with their hands. They work harder. They get more certificates. They apply to more jobs. They fix their cv. They polish their profile. But in islam, risk does not begin with your hand.
