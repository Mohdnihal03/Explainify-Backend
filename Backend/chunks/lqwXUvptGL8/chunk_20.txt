Sins darken the heart. A dark heart doesn't attract light and risk is light. The prophet sallallah. Aii wasallam said, "a servant is deprived of provision because of a sin he committed. So when risk gets blocked, look inward. Clean your heart. Make tawa. Return to allah. Say y cleanse what i cannot see. Your risk will start flowing again. " because allah opens from places you never imagined. Allah says in surah talak ayah 65: 3 and he will provide for him from where he does not expect. Did you hear that? Your job is not the source. Your connections are not the source.
