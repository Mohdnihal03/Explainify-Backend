Allah will. The prophet muhammad sallallah. Aii wasallam said if you relied upon allah with true reliance, he would provide for you he provides for the birds. The birds don't fill out applications. They don't network on linkedin. They don't have degrees. They don't attend interviews. They simply wake up, make the effort, and rely entirely on allah. And allah fills their stomach every single day. So why do you think your risk depends on a manager?
