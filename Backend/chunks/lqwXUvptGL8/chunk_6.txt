Because when allah opens a door, no manager can close it. When he writes something for you, no rejection can erase it. When he gives, he gives in ways that make you cry out of gratitude. So today, my dear family, stop panicking over applications. Stop thinking you're a failure. Stop believing others are ahead of you. You are not behind. You are being prepared. You are being polished. You are being positioned.
