The heart shift that changes everything. Here is the transformation. Stop saying i need a job. Start saying i need allah. Because when allah is with you, jobs look for you. Clients search for you. Risk runs to you. Doors open for you. People recommend you. Opportunities chase you. Baraka follows you. Not because of your cv but because of your connection. You don't rise by paper. You rise by prayer. You rise by obedience.
