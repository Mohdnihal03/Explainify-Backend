Because some doors will never open until your heart opens first. Some risk will never reach you until your soul is clean enough to carry it. Some opportunities will never come until you become the person who can handle them. Sometimes allah blocks the dunya so you can finally look toward him. Do you know what real failure is? It's not when your applications are ignored. It's not when interviews go wrong. It's not when companies never reply. Real failure is when you stop believing allah can still provide because allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has written your share of risk before you were even born before the job exists. Before the company was created, your name was written on what would reach you.
