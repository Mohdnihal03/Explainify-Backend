So tell me why are you chasing people when your risk is already chasing you? Sometimes the lack of a job is the beginning of re success. Maybe allah wants you to start something of your own. Maybe he wants you to build a skill. Maybe he wants you to rely on him, not the world. Maybe he wants you to break free from the fear of rejection. Maybe he is saving you from a job that would have destroyed your dean, your peace, your life. And maybe your pain today is the push that will lead you to your real risk tomorrow. But here's the secret. When you stop chasing jobs and start chasing allah, jobs begin chasing you.
