The moment you realize that your real journey is not toward a job but toward the one who opens jobs, let me take you deeper. The hidden test inside every no. Sometimes allah says no from the world so he can hear a yes from your heart. A yes of tawba, a yes of reliance, a yes of humility, a yes of realization that your risk was never in human hands. Ahmed applied everywhere. Sophia cried every night. Maybe you've done the same. But what changed? Did your qualifications disappear? Did your intelligence evaporate overnight? No. But allah closed a door so that your soul could open a window. A window to tahud, a window toar, a window to vulnerability before your creator. Wallah. The sweetness of a single sincere dua in sujud is more valuable than a thousand job acceptances that pull you away from allah.
