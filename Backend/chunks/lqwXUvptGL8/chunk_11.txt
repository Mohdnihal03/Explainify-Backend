When you feel you have nothing that's when allah shows you that he is everything. Because look at what happens to you in these phases. You start praying with more feeling. You start talking to allah more honestly. You start doing with a trembling voice. Your sujud becomes longer. Your dua becomes raw. Your ego melts. Your heart softens. Your reliance shifts from dunya to ra.
