And make us among those who rise not by dunya but by your mercy. Y grant us work that doesn't pull us away from salah, risk that does not corrupt our hearts, success that doesn't make us forget you, and comfort that brings us closer to jenna. And yarab when we feel lost whisper to our hearts my servant your risk is coming trust me i'm in alamin my dear ayapul's family if this reminder touched you even a little then don't let it stop here someone out there now is crying over job rejections someone is feeling forgotten someone is doubting themselves someone believes their risk is gone share this reminder so it reaches that heart. Be the reason someone says, "alhamdulillah, this is exactly what i needed. " drop a yarazzak, open my doors in the comments so thousands of angels say, "amen for you. "
