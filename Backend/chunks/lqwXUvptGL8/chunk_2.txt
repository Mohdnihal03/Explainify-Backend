Her tears fall on the prayer mat as she whispers, "yarak, i'm trying so hard. Please open a door for me. " days pass, weeks pass, months pass, still silence. And she begins to think, why isn't allah helping me? But what she doesn't know is this. When allah delays something, he is saving you from something. He is preparing you for something. He is upgrading your soul before he grades your risk. You see, akbar and sophia are doing everything except the main thing. They chase the job.
