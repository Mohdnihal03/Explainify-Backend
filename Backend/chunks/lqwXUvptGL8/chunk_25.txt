Close your eyes. Feel your heartbeat. Feel how allah subhanahu wa ta'ala brought you here, now to these words. Not by accident, not by algorithm, by mercy. Now raise your hands and whisper with me. Do a risk opening, path clearing, heart soothing. Yakulab, we are weak and you are strong. We are confused and you are the one who guides. We are searching for doors, but you are the one who creates doors from nothing. Yarab, if our risk is delayed because of our sins, forgive us.
