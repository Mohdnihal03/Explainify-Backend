Why do you believe a job title controls your destiny? Why do you think your livelihood comes from the creation when the creator himself promised to carry it? Allah isn't testing your seed. He's testing your heart. If you're losing hope, if you're tired, if you're ready to give up, listen closely. Allah is not delaying to punish you. Allah is delaying so you return to him with a heart that's awake, a heart that's alive, a heart that finally sees what it was too distracted to notice. Because when allah reorganizes your life, he reorganizes your heart first. Maybe you're not supposed to be an employee. Maybe you're supposed to be something bigger. Many people don't realize this, but some people are written by allah as providers, not job seekers. And allah will never let you settle for something smaller than what he wrote for you. This is why some people don't fit anywhere. They are rejected everywhere, not because they're unworthy, but because they're not meant to walk through doors built by others. They're meant to build their own.
