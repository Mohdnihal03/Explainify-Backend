Alhamdulillah. My beloved ayah pulse family, today's reminder might just be the turning point you've been praying for because i know you're tired, you're exhausted, you're trying so hard, you're applying everywhere, fixing your cv again and again, making dua every night, refreshing your email 20 times a day, and still silence. No calls, no interviews, no opportunities, just disappointment. And in that quiet dangerous moment, you whisper to yourself, "ya allah, why is nothing working for me? But listen to me carefully with your heart, not your ears. "
