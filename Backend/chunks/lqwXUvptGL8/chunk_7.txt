And very soon you will understand why every no was a divine wait. Something better is coming. This is not the end of your story. This is the training before the breakthrough. This is the silence before the opening. This is the test before the gift. And the one testing you is the one who loves you more than anyone in this world. My dear brothers and sisters, before i tell you what to do when the world stops responding, i need to tell you something about you. You are not as stuck as you think. And your story is not as silent as it feels.
