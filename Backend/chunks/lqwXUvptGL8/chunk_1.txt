you are not being rejected. You are being redirected. The dunya sees no response. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sees not this. I have written something better. Let me take you inside a story that reflects millions of muslims today. Akbar's story. Akbar wakes up early, makes wudoo, praise fudger, sits at his desk with hope. He opens his laptop. 10 job tabs, 10 companies, 10 chances. He rewrites his cover letter, deletes, writes again, deletes, writes again. He tries to sound confident, but his heart is shaking. He applies and waits and checks email every hour, but every day ends the same way. Nothing, not even a rejection, just silence. He thinks maybe something is wrong with me. But no, nothing is wrong with ahmed. Sophia's story. Sophia is brilliant, a top graduate. Her character shines more than her resume. She wakes for tahajjud.
