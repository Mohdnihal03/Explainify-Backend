But they forgot to chase the one who provides the job. They chased the means but forgot the source. They knocked on doors but ignored the king of all doors. They believed effort creates risk. But allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says the complete opposite. And whoever has tawa of allah, he will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he never expected. Surah talak ayah 65 2-3. He didn't say whoever sends 200 cvs, whoever gets five certifications, whoever masters interview techniques. No, he said whoever has tawa, taqua moves doors. Taqua changes destiny. Taqua brings risk even when you're not looking for it. Risk does not follow qualifications. Risk follows hearts. Let me say something powerful. You are not being rejected. You are being repositioned. You are not stuck. You are being spiritually recalibrated. Allah is not ignoring you. Allah is calling you closer.
