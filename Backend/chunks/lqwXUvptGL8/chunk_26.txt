Wash our hearts clean. Lift the burdens we cannot speak about. Erase the darkness we cannot see. Yarab, if we are chasing the wrong path, redirect us gently. Take us by the hand and pull us toward the risk that brings baraka, toward the work that brings peace, toward the life that brings us closer to you. Y grant us risk that is pure, halal, blessed, wide, constant, and full of n. Risker that lights our homes, softens our hearts, and strengthens our iman. Yarab, remove every blockage. Open every door, bless every step, make the unseen help of the angels carry us to what you wrote for us. Y put baraka in our skills, in our talents, in our ideas, in our efforts. Make our names reach the hearts of those who will open opportunities for us.
