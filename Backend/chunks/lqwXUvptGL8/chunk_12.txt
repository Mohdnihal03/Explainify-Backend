This transformation, this inner elevation is worth more than any job title on earth. This is not failure. It's realignment. A job rejection is not a closed door. It is allah redirecting your footsteps toward the path where your true risk awaits. Maybe your risk is in a place you haven't looked yet. Maybe it's in a skill you haven't discovered yet. Maybe it's in an opportunity that hasn't opened yet. Maybe it's in a business idea you haven't dared to start yet. Maybe it's in a direction your heart keeps whispering, but your fear keeps blocking. Sometimes allah shakes your world so you stop living small. So you stop begging for doors. He never wrote for you. So you finally walk toward the greatness he did write for you. Your job won't feed you.
