Some people are written by allah to walk a different path. They keep getting rejected because allah wants them to create, not comply, build, not beg, lead, not follow, open doors, not wait for them. Maybe your heart feels suffocated in normal jobs because you were not meant for them. Maybe you're struggling because allah wants you to start something of your own, a business, a brand, a skill, a project, a service, something halal, something meaningful, something that serves others. Allah will never let your soul rest in a place he didn't write for you.
