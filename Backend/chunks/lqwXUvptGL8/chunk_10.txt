What you're calling delay, allah is calling protection. What if allah subhanahu wa ta'ala kept you jobless now because the job you wanted carried sin or heartbreak or bad company or spiritual destruction? What if that salary you wanted was going to distract you from fudger? What if that office was going to suffocate your iman? What if that environment was going to dim your heart slowly until it became numb? Wouldn't you want allah to protect you from it? So instead of saying why isn't allah giving me the job? Say alhamdulillah he is protecting me from something i cannot see. You are not jobless. You are being rebuilt.
