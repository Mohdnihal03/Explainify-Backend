coding agent by claude and you can install it or you can say open ai open ai codeex and you can install that one too. So i just install codeex as well and now we're live. That's it. That's how easy it was to add these. Now you also need to log in. So when you go to codex it will say sign in with chat gpt very important do not use an api key this will cost a lot of money sign in with chatgpt so all you have to do is say sign in with chatgpt it will ask you if it should open the chat gpt website which you can say yes to and it will just ask you to log in you go through this process done and the same is true for cloud code all you have to do here is again ignore the bottom button s you do not want to click them. Just click the big orange one and it will ask you the same question. It will open claude in the browser. You will have to confirm that you want to give it access, etc. , etc. And just that, you are ready to go.
