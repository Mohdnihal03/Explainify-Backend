So it's a toolbox that handles everything needed to run a python code. So again my friend you write python code in a high language then python compiles it and translate it into the byte code the low language and then the virtual machine going to take care of everything going to take your bite code some libraries and then it going to run it at your computer to see the results. So this process happens every time you run a python code and everything is of course automated and behind the scenes. So now let's talk about why we should learn python in the first place. There are too many programming languages out there.
