So why millions of people choose python? So the first and most important reason is python is very powerful and as well at the same time very simple. You can build really serious stuff with few line of codes. So if you compare java and python, in java or c++ you're going to write a lot of lines in order to do a simple task compared to python where you need only one or two line. So as you can see python is very simple compared to other programming languages. Moving on to the second reason. Python is used everywhere and you can use it in order to build everything. So you can use it to build websites, to automate tasks, to work with data, to build games and even control robots. So whatever direction you want to go in tech, you will find probably python. Moving on to the next one. One of the best things about python is the community. You are my friend, never alone. There are thousands of developers and experts me sharing their knowledge in tutorials or they are writing blog posts and as well developing and sharing free libraries, open-source projects in github. And if you are stuck or have any complex task, i'm sure there is someone already solved it and probably made a youtube video or a github repo about it. So this type of community makes the language alive. And when it comes to ai, python is leading the way. Almost everything you hear about today shbt, image generations, self-driven car models, it's built with python because python has an incredible ecosystem for ai and machine learning. So my friends this means the programming language of ai is python and if you are interested in the future then python is the language. And now because of all these reasons python is one of the most in demand programming language in the world now. If you check any job description in the tech world you will see everyone across all industries finance, healthcare, logistics, car manufacturing, everyone is requesting python skill.
