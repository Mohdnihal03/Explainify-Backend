But my friend not all languages are the same. Some are made for people and others are made for machines. So now at the top we have the natural language you say hey please calculate 5 + 5. And we have a lot of natural languages. We have the english, spanish, hindi. They are easy for us but far too complex for computer to understand. Now moving on then we have the highlevel languages. So they are programming languages but they are made for human because they are very simplified, logical and really easy to write and to read. And we have a lot of languages python and javascript. They are high-level languages. And now next we are going lower. We are going to the low-level languages. Programming languages can talk directly to the machines, but they are really hard for humans. It's hard to read, to write, and as well to understand. And here we have examples the assembly and the c language. And now at the very bottom, we have the machine language. And this one is made of binary code, a combination of ones and zeros. And this is exactly what your computer can understand. But it is impossible for humans to read it, to understand it, to write it. So now if you look at these levels each step down it going to bring us closer on how the machine thinks and each step up it going to bring us closer on how human thinks.
