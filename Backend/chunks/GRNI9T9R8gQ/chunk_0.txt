Hey friends, so what is python? So now let's start with basics. What is programming language? So now imagine that you want to give your computer a task and you say, "hey computer, calculate 5 + 5. " well, your computer will not understand what is exactly are talking about and nothing going to happen. So we cannot use the natural human language in order to give tasks for your pc. So now instead of that, we have to give the instructions in a language where the computer understand. We write a short piece of code for example here in python print 5 + 5. Now the computer going to understand the instruction and give us the result 10. So a program it is set of instructions that is written in a language the computer can follow.
