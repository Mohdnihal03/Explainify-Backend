So things can make more sense here. And now after that, everyone going to start moving to the advanced level. And here you can start learning advanced techniques. We're going to go outside of our code in order to connect ourselves with apis in order to grab data from the internet and we're going to learn stuff how to test your codes and how to scrap website to collect data automatically and at this level you're going to start doing real projects and solving real problems. So now as you can see all those three levels they are the core of python and everyone must learn these techniques because everyone need those techniques in whatever you are building in the future.
