So let's say you open your editor and you start writing python code and usually we write the code inside a python file with the file extension of py. So here you are writing the source code. Once you run your code, the computer cannot immediately execute your instructions cuz it is really high level and the computer needs a lower level of the code. So what happens? There is something called compiler in python. It's going to take your python code and translate it to another code. It's called the pyite code with the extension pyc python compiled. And this can happen automatically and you will not even notice it. So what happened here? The compiler of python going to translate the highlevel language the python code to a low-level language the bite code. So as you can see it's really hard to understand the bite code compared to the python code. So now our code is not yet executed, python just did a translation. But now before anything to be executed, what can happen? Python might as well link some libraries. It is pre-written chunks of code that helps your code to do something specific working with files, handling data and so on. Now python has everything the bite code, the libraries and now python can run your bite code using something called python virtual machine. So it's a software that can understand the bite code of python and take care of running it. So the python virtual machine going to finally converts your instructions into machine codes once and zero because this is the only thing that your computer can really understand. And once it runs you will see at the results whatever your program was designed to do. And now all those three steps compile, translate and execute we call them the python interpreter.
