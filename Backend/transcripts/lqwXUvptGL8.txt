Alhamdulillah. My beloved ayah pulse family, today's reminder might just be the turning point you've been praying for because i know you're tired, you're exhausted, you're trying so hard, you're applying everywhere, fixing your cv again and again, making dua every night, refreshing your email 20 times a day, and still silence. No calls, no interviews, no opportunities, just disappointment. And in that quiet dangerous moment, you whisper to yourself, "ya allah, why is nothing working for me? But listen to me carefully with your heart, not your ears. " you are not being rejected. You are being redirected. The dunya sees no response. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala sees not this. I have written something better. Let me take you inside a story that reflects millions of muslims today. Akbar's story. Akbar wakes up early, makes wudoo, praise fudger, sits at his desk with hope. He opens his laptop. 10 job tabs, 10 companies, 10 chances. He rewrites his cover letter, deletes, writes again, deletes, writes again. He tries to sound confident, but his heart is shaking. He applies and waits and checks email every hour, but every day ends the same way. Nothing, not even a rejection, just silence. He thinks maybe something is wrong with me. But no, nothing is wrong with ahmed. Sophia's story. Sophia is brilliant, a top graduate. Her character shines more than her resume. She wakes for tahajjud. Her tears fall on the prayer mat as she whispers, "yarak, i'm trying so hard. Please open a door for me. " days pass, weeks pass, months pass, still silence. And she begins to think, why isn't allah helping me? But what she doesn't know is this. When allah delays something, he is saving you from something. He is preparing you for something. He is upgrading your soul before he grades your risk. You see, akbar and sophia are doing everything except the main thing. They chase the job. But they forgot to chase the one who provides the job. They chased the means but forgot the source. They knocked on doors but ignored the king of all doors. They believed effort creates risk. But allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says the complete opposite. And whoever has tawa of allah, he will make for him a way out and provide for him from where he never expected. Surah talak ayah 65 2-3. He didn't say whoever sends 200 cvs, whoever gets five certifications, whoever masters interview techniques. No, he said whoever has tawa, taqua moves doors. Taqua changes destiny. Taqua brings risk even when you're not looking for it. Risk does not follow qualifications. Risk follows hearts. Let me say something powerful. You are not being rejected. You are being repositioned. You are not stuck. You are being spiritually recalibrated. Allah is not ignoring you. Allah is calling you closer. Because some doors will never open until your heart opens first. Some risk will never reach you until your soul is clean enough to carry it. Some opportunities will never come until you become the person who can handle them. Sometimes allah blocks the dunya so you can finally look toward him. Do you know what real failure is? It's not when your applications are ignored. It's not when interviews go wrong. It's not when companies never reply. Real failure is when you stop believing allah can still provide because allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has written your share of risk before you were even born before the job exists. Before the company was created, your name was written on what would reach you. So tell me why are you chasing people when your risk is already chasing you? Sometimes the lack of a job is the beginning of re success. Maybe allah wants you to start something of your own. Maybe he wants you to build a skill. Maybe he wants you to rely on him, not the world. Maybe he wants you to break free from the fear of rejection. Maybe he is saving you from a job that would have destroyed your dean, your peace, your life. And maybe your pain today is the push that will lead you to your real risk tomorrow. But here's the secret. When you stop chasing jobs and start chasing allah, jobs begin chasing you. Because when allah opens a door, no manager can close it. When he writes something for you, no rejection can erase it. When he gives, he gives in ways that make you cry out of gratitude. So today, my dear family, stop panicking over applications. Stop thinking you're a failure. Stop believing others are ahead of you. You are not behind. You are being prepared. You are being polished. You are being positioned. And very soon you will understand why every no was a divine wait. Something better is coming. This is not the end of your story. This is the training before the breakthrough. This is the silence before the opening. This is the test before the gift. And the one testing you is the one who loves you more than anyone in this world. My dear brothers and sisters, before i tell you what to do when the world stops responding, i need to tell you something about you. You are not as stuck as you think. And your story is not as silent as it feels. Sometimes allah subhanahu wa ta'ala withholds not to punish but to wake you up to a truth you would have never seen while everything was going because listen carefully when allah wants to elevate a believer, he does not send ease. He sends awareness. He sends a shift inside the heart. He sends a feeling that says something is missing and that something is me. And jobs, careers, cvs, interviews, they become secondary. The moment you realize that your real journey is not toward a job but toward the one who opens jobs, let me take you deeper. The hidden test inside every no. Sometimes allah says no from the world so he can hear a yes from your heart. A yes of tawba, a yes of reliance, a yes of humility, a yes of realization that your risk was never in human hands. Ahmed applied everywhere. Sophia cried every night. Maybe you've done the same. But what changed? Did your qualifications disappear? Did your intelligence evaporate overnight? No. But allah closed a door so that your soul could open a window. A window to tahud, a window toar, a window to vulnerability before your creator. Wallah. The sweetness of a single sincere dua in sujud is more valuable than a thousand job acceptances that pull you away from allah. What you're calling delay, allah is calling protection. What if allah subhanahu wa ta'ala kept you jobless now because the job you wanted carried sin or heartbreak or bad company or spiritual destruction? What if that salary you wanted was going to distract you from fudger? What if that office was going to suffocate your iman? What if that environment was going to dim your heart slowly until it became numb? Wouldn't you want allah to protect you from it? So instead of saying why isn't allah giving me the job? Say alhamdulillah he is protecting me from something i cannot see. You are not jobless. You are being rebuilt. When you feel you have nothing that's when allah shows you that he is everything. Because look at what happens to you in these phases. You start praying with more feeling. You start talking to allah more honestly. You start doing with a trembling voice. Your sujud becomes longer. Your dua becomes raw. Your ego melts. Your heart softens. Your reliance shifts from dunya to ra. This transformation, this inner elevation is worth more than any job title on earth. This is not failure. It's realignment. A job rejection is not a closed door. It is allah redirecting your footsteps toward the path where your true risk awaits. Maybe your risk is in a place you haven't looked yet. Maybe it's in a skill you haven't discovered yet. Maybe it's in an opportunity that hasn't opened yet. Maybe it's in a business idea you haven't dared to start yet. Maybe it's in a direction your heart keeps whispering, but your fear keeps blocking. Sometimes allah shakes your world so you stop living small. So you stop begging for doors. He never wrote for you. So you finally walk toward the greatness he did write for you. Your job won't feed you. Allah will. The prophet muhammad sallallah. Aii wasallam said if you relied upon allah with true reliance, he would provide for you he provides for the birds. The birds don't fill out applications. They don't network on linkedin. They don't have degrees. They don't attend interviews. They simply wake up, make the effort, and rely entirely on allah. And allah fills their stomach every single day. So why do you think your risk depends on a manager? Why do you believe a job title controls your destiny? Why do you think your livelihood comes from the creation when the creator himself promised to carry it? Allah isn't testing your seed. He's testing your heart. If you're losing hope, if you're tired, if you're ready to give up, listen closely. Allah is not delaying to punish you. Allah is delaying so you return to him with a heart that's awake, a heart that's alive, a heart that finally sees what it was too distracted to notice. Because when allah reorganizes your life, he reorganizes your heart first. Maybe you're not supposed to be an employee. Maybe you're supposed to be something bigger. Many people don't realize this, but some people are written by allah as providers, not job seekers. And allah will never let you settle for something smaller than what he wrote for you. This is why some people don't fit anywhere. They are rejected everywhere, not because they're unworthy, but because they're not meant to walk through doors built by others. They're meant to build their own. And allah closes every other path until you finally understand that your risk is not trapped inside a job. It's trapped inside your courage. And as soon as your fear breaks, your destiny unfolds. Now we will talk about exactly how to open that destiny with spiritual steps, emotional steps, and practical steps. All rooted in quran and sunnah, and all aligned with your heart's journey toward allah. My dear brothers and sisters, if you've reached this point, then you already know your journey is not about chasing jobs. It's about chasing the one who opens the doors to risk. Now in this final part, i want to take you into the heart of this reminder. The part that unlocks the path ahead of you. The part that reveals why allah is putting you through this phase and how you can finally walk toward the risk written for you with clarity, certainty, and peace. The spiritual truth. Risk doesn't begin with your hand. It begins with your heart. Most people chase money with their hands. They work harder. They get more certificates. They apply to more jobs. They fix their cv. They polish their profile. But in islam, risk does not begin with your hand. It begins inside you. Inside your intention, inside your tawa, inside your trust, inside your sujud, inside your relationship with the one who feeds every bird in the sky and every fish in the sea. Your job is not the source. Your job is only the means. Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is the source. And until you understand this deeply, you will continue feeling you are climbing a portion until that keeps getting taller. When allah wants to give you more, he first empties your hands. Sometimes allah removes every job, every plan, every opportunity, and until your hands become completely empty. Why? Because if your hands are full, you won't be able to receive the blessing he's preparing for you. You won't appreciate it. You won't understand it. You won't see the miracle behind it. An empty hand feels painful, but an empty hand is ready. Ready to receive, ready to rise, ready to be elevated. And many times allah holds your risk back until your heart becomes ready for it. The divine pattern of risk effort plus tawa plus tawakul plus sodaka. If you want risk to run toward you, you must align yourself with the spiritual laws allah placed in this universe. Let me break this down for you in the simplest way. One, effort. Because allah loves action. You can't just sit and wait. Even mariam alasam was told, "shake the trunk of the palm tree. " her effort couldn't bring dates down. But her obedience invited the miracle. Apply, learn, grow, move, try. But don't place your heart on the effort. Place your heart on the one who blesses the effort. Because sin blocks risk. This is a secret most people ignore. Sins darken the heart. A dark heart doesn't attract light and risk is light. The prophet sallallah. Aii wasallam said, "a servant is deprived of provision because of a sin he committed. So when risk gets blocked, look inward. Clean your heart. Make tawa. Return to allah. Say y cleanse what i cannot see. Your risk will start flowing again. " because allah opens from places you never imagined. Allah says in surah talak ayah 65: 3 and he will provide for him from where he does not expect. Did you hear that? Your job is not the source. Your connections are not the source. Your degree is not the source. Your risk can come wrapped in a phone call from nowhere. A stranger's recommendation. A business idea that pops into your heart. A door you didn't even knock on. This is the risk that comes with tawakul saddaka. Because charity is a magnet for blessings. Charity doesn't decrease your wealth. It multiplies it. It expands it. It blesses it. It purifies it. Give even one coin, one rupee, one date, one bottle of water. Not because you have a lot, but because you trust the one who owns the treasures of the heavens and the earth. The practical reality, you are not meant for a normal life. Some people are written by allah to walk a different path. They keep getting rejected because allah wants them to create, not comply, build, not beg, lead, not follow, open doors, not wait for them. Maybe your heart feels suffocated in normal jobs because you were not meant for them. Maybe you're struggling because allah wants you to start something of your own, a business, a brand, a skill, a project, a service, something halal, something meaningful, something that serves others. Allah will never let your soul rest in a place he didn't write for you. The heart shift that changes everything. Here is the transformation. Stop saying i need a job. Start saying i need allah. Because when allah is with you, jobs look for you. Clients search for you. Risk runs to you. Doors open for you. People recommend you. Opportunities chase you. Baraka follows you. Not because of your cv but because of your connection. You don't rise by paper. You rise by prayer. You rise by obedience. You rise by sincerity. You rise by turning your heart fully toward your creator. The journey ahead of you. If your life is silent now, if every application is ignored, if every effort feels it's going nowhere, if you feel stuck in the same place, then be grateful. Yes, grateful. Because this silence is a sign of something big being written. A shift, a breakthrough, a new destiny forming behind the scenes. A risk you cannot see yet. But your heart can feel it. Allah is moving you from where you were to where you're supposed to be. And in that journey, you are not rejected. You are realigned. You are prepared. You are elevated. You are purified. You are guided. You are being shaped for something better than you imagine. My beautiful ayul family, before you scroll, before this moment slips away, let's pause. Let's breathe. Let's bring our hearts together for a dua that might change your future, your risk, your path, your direction. Close your eyes. Feel your heartbeat. Feel how allah subhanahu wa ta'ala brought you here, now to these words. Not by accident, not by algorithm, by mercy. Now raise your hands and whisper with me. Do a risk opening, path clearing, heart soothing. Yakulab, we are weak and you are strong. We are confused and you are the one who guides. We are searching for doors, but you are the one who creates doors from nothing. Yarab, if our risk is delayed because of our sins, forgive us. Wash our hearts clean. Lift the burdens we cannot speak about. Erase the darkness we cannot see. Yarab, if we are chasing the wrong path, redirect us gently. Take us by the hand and pull us toward the risk that brings baraka, toward the work that brings peace, toward the life that brings us closer to you. Y grant us risk that is pure, halal, blessed, wide, constant, and full of n. Risker that lights our homes, softens our hearts, and strengthens our iman. Yarab, remove every blockage. Open every door, bless every step, make the unseen help of the angels carry us to what you wrote for us. Y put baraka in our skills, in our talents, in our ideas, in our efforts. Make our names reach the hearts of those who will open opportunities for us. And make us among those who rise not by dunya but by your mercy. Y grant us work that doesn't pull us away from salah, risk that does not corrupt our hearts, success that doesn't make us forget you, and comfort that brings us closer to jenna. And yarab when we feel lost whisper to our hearts my servant your risk is coming trust me i'm in alamin my dear ayapul's family if this reminder touched you even a little then don't let it stop here someone out there now is crying over job rejections someone is feeling forgotten someone is doubting themselves someone believes their risk is gone share this reminder so it reaches that heart. Be the reason someone says, "alhamdulillah, this is exactly what i needed. " drop a yarazzak, open my doors in the comments so thousands of angels say, "amen for you. " and if you're part of this family, this growing circle of light, then keep your heart soft, your hope alive, and your trust in allah deep because the risk you're chasing is already chasing you. Until the next reminder, stay connected, stay rising, stay trusting. This is ay pulse and your journey is just
